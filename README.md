# ⚾ KBO Betting Edge Predictor  

## 📖 Overview  
This project predicts **Korean Baseball Organization (KBO)** game outcomes and identifies potential **positive expected value (EV)** betting opportunities. Using machine learning, historical KBO game data, and betting odds, the model estimates win probabilities, compares them with bookmaker implied probabilities, and simulates bankroll growth through backtesting.  

The goal is to showcase applied **data science, sports analytics, and predictive modeling** in a real-world context.
