## Key features:

- Scraped/collected historical KBO and odds data
- ML models (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost)
- Simulated bankroll growth via backtesting
- Visualizations of ROI and model calibration

## Tech stack:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## Results summary:

- ROI achieved in backtesting (if positive, highlight!)
- Calibration curve performance

## How to run:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kbo-betting-edge-predictor.git
